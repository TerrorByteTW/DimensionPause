# Dimension Pause ðŸŒŽâŒš

## What is Dimension Pause?
Dimension Pause is a super simple, lightweight plugin that allows you to temporarily block players from creating dimension portals or entering dimensions.

It works by detecting players attempting to create portals, or detecting when a player switches worlds (Such as entering an already-existing portal, or using Essentials's `/home` feature). When this happens,
if the world is paused and certain criteria is not met, the player is either blocked from creating the portal, or kicked out of the world.

If the player is currently in a dimension when it is disabled, then they are kicked out to either their bed or a world defined in config.

## Future Features
* Support multiple worlds as well as dimensions
  * Currently, if you create multiple Nether worlds with a multi-world plugin, such as MultiVerse, you can only disable *all* Nether worlds, not just specific ones.
* Support Velocity / BungeeCord
* Temporarily disable dimensions (Disable dimensions for an hour, for example)
* Create an API for developers to integrate with DimensionPause
